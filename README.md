# Welcome to the README!

This is a quick run down of my current and future plans for this site.

---

- site will be completely static once built, it's a requirement for gh-pages anyway
- interactivity will be introduced via [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/)
- dev server will be [express](https://expressjs.com/) to more quickly build
- templates will be in [ejs](https://ejs.co/), leveraging the power of javascript in embedded templates
- I think I'll store the data in a sqlite database, using [sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite)
  - can use tagged template literals via [sql-template-tags](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sql-template-strings)
